# Threat Detection System using CNN and NASNet Mobile

## Project Description

In this project, we have developed a Threat Detection System employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with NASNet Mobile as the backbone. The system is designed to identify potential threats, with a current focus on detecting weapons in its initial phase. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model has achieved an impressive accuracy of 85 percent.

### Motivation

The rising concerns around public safety and security necessitate the development of intelligent systems capable of swift threat detection. This project aims to contribute to this imperative by harnessing the power of deep learning to identify weapons in images, laying the groundwork for a broader threat detection framework.

### Key Features

- **CNN Architecture:** The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network, a class of deep learning models particularly effective for image recognition tasks.

- **NASNet Mobile Backbone:** NASNet Mobile serves as the base architecture, offering a balance between computational efficiency and high performance, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

- **Weapon Detection:** The system is trained to detect weapons in images, making it a valuable tool for security applications.

- **Accuracy and Performance:** The model achieves an accuracy of 85 percent in its current state, showcasing its efficacy in threat detection.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into key directories:

- **`/data`:** Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
  
- **`/models`:** Holds the trained model files.

- **`/notebooks`:** Jupyter notebooks used for experimentation and model training.
